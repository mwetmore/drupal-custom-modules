Custom Drupal Modules by mwetmore
===============================

This GitHub repository contains some experimental modules which I am messing around with at the moment.  So of them are stable, some of them aren't
but feel free to touchbase with me on Twitter ([@mwetmore][http://twitter.com/mwetmore]) and I'll let you know.  I'll also try and keep the entries below up to date so that you
know exactly what is going on.  Thanks!

Context Google Analytics
------------------------
The Drupal Context Module [(Link)][http://drupal.org/project/context] is a powerful module that allows you to easily modify the placement of Blocks, Menus, and
Styles based upon conditions which are defined.  The Context Google Analytics module creates the option for a number of conditions based upon values in
a users Google Analytics Cookie, once enabled the following conditions will be available:
- GA Campaign
- GA Source
- GA Medium
- GA Content
- GA Term
- GA Total Visits

This module source is for Drupal 7, I have a Drupal 6 version the works, and it requires that the following modules also be installed:
- Token (In D7 Core) [link][http://drupal.org/project/token]
- Context [link][http://drupal.org/project/context]
- Google Analytics  [link][http://drupal.org/project/google_analytics]
- Google Analytics Tokenizer [link][http://drupal.org/project/ga_tokenizer]
